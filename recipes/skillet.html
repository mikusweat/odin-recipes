    <h2>Description</h2>
    I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these 
    ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted
     for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest 
     adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.
     <h2>ingredients</h2>
     <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
     <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
     <li>2 ½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <li>Whisk onion, soy sauce, brown sugar</li>
     <li>Cook and stir chicken and marinade together in a large skillet</li>
     <li>over medium-high heat until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
